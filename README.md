# SOC-Automation

## Objective

This SOC Automation project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen my understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM/SOAR concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Wazuh was the primary SIEM system used for log ingestion and analysis.
- Shuffle was utilized as my SOAR system used for automation and workflow management.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
